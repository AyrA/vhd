# VHD

This is a VHD toolkit that allows you to create and edit VHD files.
This does not use any Windows VHD API calls and should work across different platforms.

## Status

This is still in development.

### TODO

Note: items marked as complete are not necessarily usable as-is.
I will likely write the command line interface towards the end.
As of now you have to write your own.
